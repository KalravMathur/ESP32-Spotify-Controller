# Spotify-ESP32-Controller
ðŸŽµ Spotify Music Controller ðŸŽµ an advanced ESP32-based Spotify Controller integrating FreeRTOS for concurrent task management, enabling seamless parallel processing of Spotify API requests. Implemented hardware interrupts to ensure immediate and reliable button press detection, enhancing user interaction responsiveness. Employed mutexes to achieve robust synchronization between dual cores, ensuring thread-safe operations and efficient resource management. This project demonstrates proficiency in real-time operating systems, interrupt handling, and multi-core synchronization within embedded systems.
